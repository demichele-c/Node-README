## Description

This project is a command-line application built with Node.js and Inquirer.js. It automates the creation of a professional-quality README.md file for software projects. By prompting users with questions about their project, such as its description, installation instructions, usage, and licensing options, the application dynamically generates a markdown file (README.md). This ensures consistency and saves time for developers, enabling them to quickly document their projects with structured sections like Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
